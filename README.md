# Simple CPU Management GUI
This app is my really first app written in Python!
I'm working and playing on laptop, so, I need to control my CPU frequency to avoid useless overheating. On Windows, I generally use [ThrottleStop](https://www.techpowerup.com/download/techpowerup-throttlestop/), but now I'm using a Linux distribution as my primary OS, and when I started to use *cpupower*, I thought about making a GUI to change governor policy and speed easily! After some time, here it is!

## Usage
Pretty straightforward, open the executable, change what you want to, and click on the corresponding button to validate your choices.

## Notes
Feel free to tell me if I can improve this app, or if you have bugs or suggestions!
